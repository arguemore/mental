### What is it?

It is not being able to plan for the future and only being able to prioritize surviving today. All my brain's resources are about surviving today. The brain learns to stop planning for the future because any plan for the future can change depending on my parent's decisions. 

### How does it occur in my life?

Always standing by for any orders from my mother. I look at my day and think there's no point in planning for tomorrow because most of my days's hours are spent on chores or on just being on standby for mama's orders. 

### What are proposed ways of dealing with it?

Moving out.
