## Right. What's all this then?

This is where I'll be documenting my discoveries about my mental health issues, how to go about resolving them, log my next steps, and write my updates about how it's going.

## Legend

There are two kind of notes in this site: notes and logs.

Notes are things that I resonate with in the world of psychology, things that I finally found names for that could apply to my situation. 

Notes are not absolute. They will be discussed with the appropriate professionals that I see. A note will have a status which will say if it applies to me or if it doesn't. Why it applies or why it doesn't apply will also be explained.

The statuses are: resonates, discussing, applicable, or archived.

Another thing is that the notes have logs.

Logs are log entries of my progress, updates, or findings about a statement and how it's related to me. 

## Credits and changes

The main source code for the theme is from [HeySora.net](https://github.com/HeySora/garden.heysora.net). I tweaked the theme a little to suit my needs. Here are the list of changes, codewise and systemwise:

- Sora's original notes not included
- Divided the notes into notes and logs, with notes having a feed of logs to track my progress or findings with a certain note
- The graph only generating notes
- Added statement status to check whether the statement still applies to me or not
