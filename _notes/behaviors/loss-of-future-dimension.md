## What is it?

It is not being able to plan for the future. All the brain's resources are about surviving today. The brain learns to stop planning for the future because any plan for the future can change depending on the parent's decisions (Dr. Kanojia, 2024)

## How does it occur in my life?

I'm always on standby for my mother's orders (or at least I used to be since we don't really talk anymore and I've given up on trying to fulfill their unattainable expectations of me). 

I look at my day and think there's no point in doing anything else today. When I get into the flow of a task and my mother asks me to do something, then I'm done with the task she asked for, I find it hard to lock back in. It's the same with the following day. I would think there's no point in planning for tomorrow, or planning to exert energy on anything that aren't her orders because they'll consume the better part of my day. 

## How does this affect me?

As Dr. K continues to state in the video, "when you grow up in a home environment where there's no rules or organization and you're focused on survival, that becomes baked in. And what happens when these people grow up is that they are [[bound by external stimuli]]."

This has made it hard for me to keep commitments and manage time properly. I have also not been able to earn. Because in order to earn, you need to set out some time to do work, and I don't really have the luxury of having my own time; Or having the luxury of being able to say no to the tasks my mother orders me to do, and have that boundary be respected. When I have to do work, I have to do it when everyone else is asleep so I won't be disturbed. 

[comment]: Have boundary be respected above link to narcissistic abuse post. Have trying to please other people below link to emotional neglect post. Also, reflect on mama wanting you to be on standby all the time and how that was what happened to her as a kid. 

Because of the shame and the guilt this inability to plan things out causes, I keep trying to please other people by saying that I can perform so that I can get jobs and prove my shame and guilt wrong. However, this always backfires on me because delivering on time poses a challenge when you don't own your own time, and when you can't plan ahead of you.

## How does this affect others in my life?

Since I cannot estimate time properly or manage time properly, people undestandably get pissed at me for not being able to deliver the way that I promised. Whether it is a deliverable or a getting to a certain place on time, I have had my fair share of people getting disappointed because I don't know how to be punctual. 

## What are proposed ways of dealing with it?

Moving out. 

## What are the ways I've worked on it?

Recently, I have learned how to estimate time when going to places using the app, Waze. My problem, before, was that I sucked so much at time estimation. 

I know it's something I should have known from the start but I really couldn't figure out for the life of me how people just figured out how to be punctual. It turned out to be just simple maths.
