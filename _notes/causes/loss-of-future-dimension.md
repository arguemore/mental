## What is it?

It is not being able to plan for the future. All the brain's resources are about surviving today. The brain learns to stop planning for the future because any plan for the future can change depending on say the parent's decisions (Dr. Kanojia, 2024)

## How does it occur in my life?

Always standing by for any orders from my mother. I look at my day and think there's no point in planning for tomorrow or planning to exert energy on anything that aren't her orders because most of my days's hours are spent on chores or on just being on standby for mama's orders. 

## How does this affect me?

As Dr. K continues to state in the video, "when you grow up in a home environment where there's no rules or organization and you're focused on survival, that becomes baked in. And what happens when these people grow up is that they are [[bound by external stimuli]]."

## How does this affect others in my life?

Since I cannot estimate time properly 

## What are proposed ways of dealing with it?

Moving out. 

## What are the ways I've worked on it?

Recently, I have learned how to estimate time when going to places using the app, Waze. My problem, before, was that I sucked so much at time estimation. 

I know it's something I should have known from the start but I really couldn't figure out for the life of me how people just figured out how to be punctual. It turned out to be just simple maths.
