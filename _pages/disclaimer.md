My mindset on the whole matter is of the keywords: curiosity, compassion, causal layer analysis, and critical thinking.

### Curiosity

I'm curious about myself, why I am the way I am, why I behave the way I behave. I want to know what's wrong inside so I can finally function like a real human being and be proactive in my own becoming. I want to name the experiences that have influenced me to cope in ways that were good for me then but bad for me now.

### Compassion

I'm growing compassion towards myself, letting go of the shame that made everything hazy. I'm letting go of the guilt that made everything so hard to unravel and so hard to understand. I also hold compassion towards my parents. I probably shouldn't, for all they've put me through psychologically, but at the end of the day, love and anger are two sides of the same coin.

### Causal Layer Analysis

I also want to emphasize how causal layer analysis is so important in all of this. Multiple factors play their parts in multiple levels of my situation. I know my parents have also been through a lot, and there are numerous factors to consider in discussing why they are the way that they are. Since it's intergenerational trauma we're talking about, I hold space for them and empathize but no longer at my expense.

### Critical Thinking

In partnership with causal layer analysis, I think it's only right that I pass every note or theory I have through a critical lense. As layered as my feelings for my parents are, to remain objective about my observations would yield the best outcome for this mini study of myself.
