## Right, what's all this then?

This is where I'll be documenting my discoveries about my mental health issues, how to go about resolving them, log my next steps, and write my updates about how it's going.

## Who is Gregor Samsa?

Gregor Samsa is the main character in Franz Kafka's short story, The Metamorphosis. I find that I relate to him in a lot of ways, especially when it comes to family.

Gregor Samsa is a traveling salesman who wakes up one day to find that he has transformed into a giant insect. His family is disgusted with him, especially when he is no longer able to earn income. Gregor eventually dies after deciding that he is a burden to his family.

In The Metamorphosis, Kafka explores various themes. The main themes explored within the story are alienation, the complexities of familial relationships, absurdism, and transformation.

## Contents of this site

These are the kinds of notes in this site:
- My **experiences**
- My **behaviors** now as a result of those experiences
- Proposed **solutions** to the behaviors I have to unlearn
- **Logs** of my progress with regards to the proposed solutions

Notes are things that I resonate with in the world of psychology, things that I finally found names for that could apply to my situation. 

Notes are not absolute. They will be discussed with the appropriate professionals that I see.

A note will have a status which will say if it applies to me or if it doesn't. Why it applies or why it doesn't apply will also be explained.

**The statuses are: resonates, discussing, applicable, or archived.**

Another thing is that the notes could have logs.

**Logs are entries of my progress, updates, or findings** about a note. 

## Credits and changes

The main source code for the theme is from [HeySora.net](https://github.com/HeySora/garden.heysora.net). I tweaked the theme a little to suit my needs. Here are the list of changes, codewise and systemwise:

- Sora's original notes not included
- Divided the notes into notes and logs, with notes having a feed of logs to track my progress or findings with a certain note
- The graph only generating notes
- Added statement status to check whether the statement still applies to me or not
