# February 22, 2025

From the last time [[changelog/December 01, 2024]], I have migrated hosting to Netlify. I have also applied the changes that were updated in the Nokigiri package.

To solve the SCSS problem arising in styles that says `{ expected`, I found [this solution.](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/error-in-step-by-step-tutorial/7984/14) but it didn't work. 

What worked was Github Copilot's suggestion:
> The error `{ expected` typically indicates a syntax error in your SCSS file. In this case, it seems to be related to the front matter section at the top of your main.scss file. SCSS does not support YAML front matter directly.
>
>To fix this, you should remove the front matter section from your SCSS file
