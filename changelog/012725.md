Main error:
When `bundle exec jekyll serve` is run, the following errors show up

| **Error** | **Details** | **Possible Solution** | **Source** | **Status** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |  
| `@import` is deprecated for Sass | Deprecation Warning: Sass @import rules are deprecated and will be removed in Dart Sass 3.0.0. | Use @use instead of @import now | [Link](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/issues/7771) | Not resolved, it's for vite config |
| Same problem still | Same | Install rouge gem | [Link](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/issues/1875) | Not resolved, I already have rouge lol | 

### Look into: 
- [ ] Try [ntkme rec](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sass-converter/issues/116#issuecomment-850912425) and upload site on Vercel instead of GH pages
